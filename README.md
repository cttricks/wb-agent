WB-Agent is a small, fun side project I built using Go. It's designed to translate natural language into SQL queries, making it dynamic enough for anyone to tweak and use with MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or any other tool you prefer.

### Why I Built This

This project started as a learning experiment â€” a way to explore:

- Go programming  
- Windows system commands  
- AI agents and tools  

Itâ€™s not meant as a polished product, just a playground for experimenting and having fun with code.

### Open-Source & Customizable

- Licensed under **MIT**, so you can explore the code, fork it, or compile your own version.  
- Designed **only for Windows**.  

If you want to dive deeper, you can **clone the repo** and start experimenting right away. For a quick test, a **ready-to-run `.exe`** is available.

### Getting Started

- Check **Windows-Setup-Guide.md** for instructions on local setup and usage.  
- This will guide you through running the tool, connecting it to your workbench, and generating SQL queries from natural language.

### Contributions & Collaboration

This is a humble side project made for learning and experimentation. Contributions are **welcome**!  
If you have ideas to improve it or make it even more flexible, letâ€™s collaborate and enhance it together.

ðŸ«° Happy coding!
